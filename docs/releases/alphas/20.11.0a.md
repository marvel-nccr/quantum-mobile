    - Filename: `quantum_mobile_20.11.0a.ova`
    - MD5 hash: `a964f0dae2646d0d2ed7acf755d4e1f4`
 2. Install Virtual Box 6.1.6 or later (see <https://www.virtualbox.org>)
 3. Import virtual machine image into Virtualbox (12.3 GB)
    File => Import Appliance

Login credentials: username: `max`, password: `moritz`.
The default configuration of `2` cores and `1536` MB RAM can be adjusted in the VM settings.

Alternatively, Quantum Mobile is available as a public image on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (see [finding shared AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/usingsharedamis-finding.html)).

## Changelog

The key additions for this release are:

- aiida-core v1.5.0 (in a Python 3.7 environment)
- Jupyter Lab (and NodeJS) installation
- Big-DFT executable and AiiDa plugin
- Abinit executable and AiiDa plugin

See the software summary for more information.

Note, AiiDA Lab is not included in this image, due to ongoing changes in its implementation, but is intended for a future release.

This release also follows a major refactoring of the build process, testing and documentation, to provide a more user-friendly experience.
