# v21.05.1

A Virtual Machine for Computational Materials Science

## Installation instructions

Get Quantum Mobile running on your computer in three simple steps:

 1. Download virtual machine image (4.3 GB)
    - URL: <https://bit.ly/3vtxji8>
    - Filename: `quantum_mobile_21.05.1.ova`
    - MD5 hash: `7f685b23cf76fe5d2075016c9f04a984`
 2. Install Virtual Box 6.1.6 or later (see <https://www.virtualbox.org>)
 3. Import virtual machine image into Virtualbox (13.2 GB)
    File => Import Appliance

Login credentials: username: `max`, password: `moritz`.  
The default configuration of `2` cores and `1536` MB RAM can be adjusted in the VM settings.

Alternatively, this Quantum Mobile is available as a Docker image: <https://hub.docker.com/r/marvelnccr/quantum-mobile>
